Convert Shopify Orders to Woo Commerce

## Installation
I use setuptools for installation, and I have created a gitignore
for `venv` so you can simply issue the commands below in your terminal
to install and activate the environment.
```
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install --editable .
```
